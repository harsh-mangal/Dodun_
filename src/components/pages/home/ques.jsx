        "Having a website is not enough these days. The internet has become one of the most competitive spaces and everyone is competing with the mass amounts of traffic and users online.

Promotion of your website via other digital marketing channels is important to set your business apart and give you every opportunity to attract a new visitors, which will hopefully turn into new customer.",
        "Digital marketing is the promotion of your brand and the service you need to battle against competitors that do not only exist locally, but now exist nationally and internationally against your business.",

          "With how fast technology changes, it is recommended to audit your website at least once every two years. When designing a website, be sure to keep in mind developing a design that will withstand the test of time. We abide by the idea that simple and minimalistic design that delivers information quickly and easily will always be in.",

      answer:
       [
        "An SEO strategy is one that is going to pay dividends down the road. We like to use this analogy for SEO efforts:",
        "Imagine trying to push a large boulder. At first, it is extremely hard to get the giant object that is not moving to start moving. But, once you start to apply more and more pressure and energy, the boulder slowly begins to move. Once the boulder starts to move it becomes easier and easier to get the boulder to move faster and faster. At some point, if youâ€™re not careful, the boulder will be rolling out of control. This is the same as SEO efforts.",
        "Earning SEO rankings do not happen overnight because there are many other competitors that are either better positioned or have been putting in SEO efforts for a longer period of time. But, once your website starts to see increased rankings then it is really like a chain-effect. Traffic will increase more and more as we place you higher in search rankings and things will start to grow exponentially month-over-month as we continue to add more and more relevant content and information that leads back to your website."

        "SEO is important because it helps to make your presence and visibility online much more prominent. When performing SEO efforts, we are creating valuable information and social proof that leads online users back to your business. This inbound marketing strategy is so incredibly valuable and will allow you to reach potential customers that you might not have ever reached in the past. A strong SEO strategy can take your business from zero to one hundred and create an impenetrable force online.",
